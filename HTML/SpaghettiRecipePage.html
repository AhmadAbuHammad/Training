        <h3>The Journey to the Lake</h3>
        <p>I still remember going fishing with my grandfather <em>early</em> in the morning to the lake. 
            He would wake me up before daylight and we would hop into his old ford truck.
            The morning <em>breez</em> would gently wake me by the time we arrived at the lake.
            Once there, he wouild secure my life-vest and we would jump into this silver boat and head out
            to his favorite stop. I don't remember the conversations that much, but I always enjoyed it just 
            being the two of us and catching the <strong>fish</strong>.
        </p>
        <h3>The Cooking</h3>
        <p>No matter what we cought, large or small my grandmother would clean it, season it and have it fried by
            lunch time. I wish i had asked her about recipes then. but hindsight is always <strong>20/20</strong>. 
            This is why i figured I would merge my new programming skills and create a recipe using HTML lists.
